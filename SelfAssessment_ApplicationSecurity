Green Corridor S.E.C.U.R.E. 6 — The AppSec Baseline Self Assessment by DG
(Score each pillar 0–5. 0 = non-existent, 5 = fully implemented & measured.)

Pillar	What It Covers	0–5 Example Criteria	Gamified Feel
S — Secure Coding Practices	Secure coding standards, OWASP Top 10 coverage, linting, code review for security.	
0 = no coding standard; 5 = codified standards, mandatory security code reviews, automated linting for security flaws.	

E — Early Threat Modelling	STRIDE/PASTA in design phase, risk-based mitigation planning.	
0 = no TM; 5 = TM in every major feature design, tracked in backlog.	

C — Continuous Testing	SAST, DAST, SCA in CI/CD; automated pipeline gating.	
0 = no automation; 5 = integrated scans with zero criticals allowed to pass.	

U — User & Identity Security	Strong auth (MFA, OAuth2/OIDC), least privilege, session controls.	
0 = hardcoded creds; 5 = MFA, short-lived tokens, role-based auth validated server-side.	

R — Resilience & Recovery	Logging, monitoring, alerting, rollback plans, secure error handling.	
0 = no logging; 5 = centralized immutable logs, monitored 24/7, tested incident recovery.	

E — Education & Awareness	DevSecOps training, secure coding workshops, phishing sims.	
0 = no training; 5 = mandatory annual refreshers + security champions in every squad.
